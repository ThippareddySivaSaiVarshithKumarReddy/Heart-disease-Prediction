# Heart Disease Prediction

A simple end-to-end heart disease prediction system built with Python.  
The project includes data preprocessing, model training (Logistic Regression), model serialization (Pickle), and a Flask web application for making predictions. The deployed app loads the saved model and returns a prediction based on user input.


# Project Overview
This repository demonstrates a basic machine learning pipeline for predicting heart disease risk. The pipeline covers:
- data cleaning and preprocessing  
- exploratory data analysis (notebooks included)  
- training a Logistic Regression classifier  
- saving the trained model using `pickle`  
- building a Flask web app (`app.py`) that loads the saved model and serves predictions via an HTML form.

# Tech Stack
- Python 3.x  
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn  
- Flask
- Jupyter Notebook   
- Pickle 

# Dataset
This project uses the classic heart disease dataset (e.g., UCI Heart Disease dataset). The dataset contains patient attributes such as:
- Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting ECG, Max Heart Rate, Exercise-induced Angina, Oldpeak, Slope, Number of Major Vessels, Thalassemia.
